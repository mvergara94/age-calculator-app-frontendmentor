## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form :heavy_check_mark:
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted :heavy_check_mark:
  - The day number is not between 1-31 :heavy_check_mark:
  - The month number is not between 1-12 :heavy_check_mark:
  - The year is in the future :red_circle:
  - The date is invalid, e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April) :red_circle:
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size :heavy_check_mark:
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page :heavy_check_mark:
- Bonus: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted :red_circle:

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox 
- Media queries
- Javascript
- DOM


### What I learned

I practice my CSS and HTML a lot in this project, and learned so much about css pseudo-elements. The Javascript part in this challenge is very simple and i did my best to make it the more readable i could.

### Continued development

I still have a lot to improve on this project, starting with the minimum functionality checklist for the project. Usually, I only post challenges when I finish, but I'm having difficulty and I hope someone from Frontend Mentor can help me finish it.


### Useful resources

- [JS documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - I researched a lot in here.
